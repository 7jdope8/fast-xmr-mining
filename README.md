# Welcome to fast-xmr-mining

This script was made to compile, install, configure and launch xmr-stak-cpu as fast as possible.

Tu run it simply paste :
```
git clone https://github.com/Kuaaaly/xmr-mining.git
bash ./xmr-mining/xmr-mining.sh
```

Prerequisites :
- Debian based distro
- Sudo access
- 2 cores machine (otherwise, you would have modification to make to config.txt file)

Next improvements :
- Run xmr-stak-cpu as dedicated user (not root). I've don't it like that tonight because I was in a hurry
- Support all hardware / CPU configuration by running xmr-stak-cpu with "cpu_threads_conf": null, first
- Support custom donation level for xmr-stak-cpu

If you think I deserve it, donations are more than welcome :
